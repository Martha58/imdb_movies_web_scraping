# imdb_movies_web_scraping

# Project Overview

In this project, I utilized Selenium, a powerful web automation tool, to scrape data from IMDb, one of the largest and most comprehensive online movie databases. The goal was to extract detailed information from a table on the website related to movies, such as titles, release years, rating, and duration.

This project involved navigating the dynamic web pages of IMDb, handling JavaScript-rendered content, and identifying the appropriate HTML elements for data extraction. By leveraging Selenium's robust capabilities, I automated the process of interacting with the website, including clicking through pages, searching for specific content, and handling pagination.

The scraped data was structured into a well-organized format, making it ready for analysis or integration into further applications, such as recommendation systems or visualizations. This project demonstrates expertise in web scraping techniques, dynamic content handling, and data processing, showcasing the ability to extract meaningful insights from large-scale online data sources.
